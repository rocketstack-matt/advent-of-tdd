# Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is an annual coding contest run by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz) run during the Christmas advent period each year. The contest posts a new puzzle each day of advent and you're free to use whatever language you like to find a solution to the puzzles.

Each day is split into two parts, the second of which is only shown to you once you have solved the first part. And be warned, the puzzles can get hard fast!

Advent of Code is a great opportunity to try to learn a new language or hone your coding skills and we're going to use it as an opportunity to apply [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) techniques.

## Workshop

In this workshop you will use the Day 1 problem from Advent of Code 2022.
In the following exercises you will review the day 1 instructions, design and implement your tests first. We will guide you on some of the design and thought process behind each exercise.

These pages you're reading are hosted on GitHub Pages published from the [main workshop repo](https://github.com/jpgough/advent-of-tdd/). To work your way through the workshop it is advised you follow ths instructions in a browser here, whilst working on a local fork of the repo working in the `main` branch. If all goes well you will continue to build upon your work through each exercise.

If you do get stuck you will find other branches `exercise-1` through `exercise-5`. These branches have a working version of the solution for the exercise in question which you can use to unstick yourself.
