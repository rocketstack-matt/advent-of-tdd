## Exercise 5

Were you able to get your first Star? If the result wasn't correct try taking a look at our [Solution](https://github.com/jpgough/advent-of-tdd/tree/exercise-5). In this branch we have changed the day1-elf-calories.txt to our personal input, so you should get an answer of `70613`. If you don't try comparing your implementation to ours to see where you may have gone wrong.

### A New Part of the Problem

[Part 2](/workshop/day-1-part-2) brings in a change in the requirements, just like real life!
The change is quite easy to implement, we now need to find the top 3 total calories for the Elves.
Let's add a new test to `TestElfCalorieCounter` to finish today's puzzle.
You can find the solution in the [exercise-5](https://github.com/jpgough/advent-of-tdd/tree/final) branch.

A big part of TDD is following the Red, Green, Refactor processes.
Spend some time working through both the tests and the subject under test and refactor as necessary.


If it does, it's time to get your first `Star`; each contestants input is unique to themselves (to ensure you solved it rather than seeing someone else's answer). Make sure you're logged into [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and you should be able to get your personal puzzle input [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input). Replace the contents of `day1-elf-calories.txt` with your personal input and rerun the solution to get your answer!
