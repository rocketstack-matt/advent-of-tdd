## Getting started

Whilst you're welcome to follow these exercises in any language of your choosing and the lessons should be equally applicable from a problem-solving perspective, the code provided here is written using Java.

We've tried to make this workshop as accessible as possible. Every branch contains a `.devcontainer` folder which is a preconfigured development environment.

To get started we recommend you `fork` this repo, so you have your own copy to work on, when forking the repo select the option to fork all branches, if you forget to choose that then you can run `git fetch --all`. You can either clone your fork to your local computer and work with any IDE or text editor of your choice, but if you use one which supports [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) such as VS Code then the `.devcontainers` configuration in this repo will suggest you install the devcontainers extension and if you do so then it can use that information to automatically install the tools you will need including the JDK and Maven.

If you want to make it even easier you can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) which are cloud hosted development environments. Every GitHub account comes with a number of free devcontainer hours, even the free ones, so if you would like to do that take a look at the [Codespaces](/codespaces/) page which will explain in detail how to use them.

## Let's get started

If you're ready to go, let's go to [Exercise 1](/workshop/exercise-1/) and get moving. Happy coding!
